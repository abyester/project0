"# project0"

    Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.

Done - navigation via nav (borrowed from bootstrap) on all pages plus links on front index page

    Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.

Done

    Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
    Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.

Done.  An SCSS stylesheet contains all the non-bootsrap formatting.

    Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.

Done. Though the media query is in meisner.html as it refers to actual content - shorter on smaller pages; and longer on bigger ones.

    You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.

Done.  Site takes advantage of bootstrap, bootrap card functionality, and bootrap columns (both for the cells on different improv games - in improve 1 and 2 and for the card)

    Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.

Done. Nesting is used to format all the improv game items under the relevant div/class.  Inheritance is used both for these game items (where there is the same base but different colours for odd and even cells); and for the table where the table header and footer have the same basic formatting but again different colours.

    In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

Here it is.
